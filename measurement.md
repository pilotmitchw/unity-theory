# Types of Measurement
## Is it?
A bowl is a bowl. It's not a plate. It's not a 'bo'. If you cut it in half, you have garbage.

## Is it before/after?
A train has many cars. There is a car that is first, one that is second, and so on.

## How many?
You can have 3 apples or 4 apples. You can have a tiny one and a huge one, but it doesn't make sense to say 
"this large apple is 3 times more 'an apple' than this small one"

## How much?
If I give you a pile of sand, you can make a pile half as much as it, and it makes sense to say "this pile is half
as large as the first pile"
