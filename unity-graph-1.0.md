## The Topology: The Unity Graph
Reality is mapped on a Radial Polar Coordinate System.
Structure
- The Origin: The Self (me). The point of connection to Unity.
- Relative Origination: The Self is capable only of realizing and generalizing relative to itself, not the Unity. However, we refer to the origin of a Unity Graph as 'Unity' to recognize that the Self is the closest one will be to the Unity while still being defined.
- Radius (r): Level of Differentiation. (r=0 is Unity; r=max is hyper-specific detail).
- Angle (θ): Properties/Qualities (e.g., Physicality, Color, Logic).
### The Object as "Image"
An object is not a point; it is a Closed Loop Path (Trajectory).

- The Loop: The path begins at the Self, travels outward through specific properties (Realization), and curves back to the Self (Closure).
- Identity: The "Shape" of this closed loop constitutes the definition of the object.
