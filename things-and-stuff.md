Let's treat Everything and Nothing as things. Each is a thing, its own thing.

"From Nothing comes Nothing"
We're assuming that Nothing is a thing. From A comes A. Seems logical. A comes from A.
But where does 'something' come from?


But what if both are stuff?
"From No Stuff comes No Stuff"

What is 'No Stuff'? In this context, we mean "the lack of any stuff".
