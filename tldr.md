# TL;DR
Everything is stuff. I call that stuff Unity. It's the thing that has no individual identity or limits. Unity
is everything and nothing at the same time. You are part of Unity observing Unity. When you think about a part of it, 
you make that part a thing, but it costs energy. Entropy exists and increases, so when you forget it, it's just stuff 
again. The differences in stuff are real, so we have to make things to survive, but our brains are lazy, so they cheat 
and usually get away with it. Remember that everyone else's brains are doing the same thing. Being smart means knowing 
when it's probably fine to let it cheat and when to make it show its work.  It's hard to change your mind because your
brain makes familiar things easier to think about. Changing yourself is the hardest thing because you have to think
about everything else again and figure out where it is relative to the new you.
