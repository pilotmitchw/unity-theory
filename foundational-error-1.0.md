# The error of singular 'Everything' and 'Nothing'
Both names for Unity, 'Everything' and 'Nothing,' commit the same error--trying to make
all of 'stuff' into one 'thing.'

Let's consider the usual, intuitive idea that the opposite of Everything is Nothing. Everything exists, we can apply 'not'
to it, and we get Nothing because the opposite of 'all the stuff' is 'no stuff', right?

Actually...no, it isn't. This mistake comes from using first-order logic, where the notion
of _quantity_ is not considered. In _second-order_ logic, which includes quantity, applying
of the 'Universal quantifier' (A) yields the existential quantifier (backwards E). In English, this means that 
the inverse of "Everything" is not "Nothing." It is "Not Everything" or _'Something OR Nothing'_. So the opposite of 'all the stuff' is
actually 'some of the stuff or possibly no stuff.'

Let's consider "From Nothing comes Nothing" in light of this. This is assumed to be true in a lot of Western Philosophy.
But let's restate it in a way that shouldn't be objectionable. "From no things comes no things". But can you get 
Everything from Nothing? That's really the question we want to answer, isn't it? We say "You can't get Something from 
Nothing" but we never say "You can't get Everything from Nothing." We do this because we assume that if you can't 
have even one thing from nothing, you're certainly not getting ALL the things from it because you'd have to 
take one thing from it first.

But...if that one thing was "all the things, all at the same time," can you get there? Let's see.

Probably reasonable assumptions
- Things exist
- All the things exist as a group we call Everything or 'all the stuff'
- There is a thing called Nothing that contains zero of the things that exist, commonly referred to as Void or 'no stuff at all'

We're not going to assume anything about how any things got here or what they're up to at the moment. There's just 
- things
- all the stuff
- no stuff at all

Fortify yourself with caffeine and possibly ibuprofen because here we go.

If Nothing, then Nothing.
Nothing OR not Nothing


This is how it's usually presented
- "From Nothing comes Nothing" is an *implication*, so it should be restated as one. "If Nothing, then Nothing"
- Negating an implication results in "Nothing OR NOT Nothing"
- A thing OR not that thing is always true, regardless of nothing or not.

But let's try another way
- "From no stuff at all comes no stuff at all"
- "If no stuff at all, then no stuff at all"
- "No stuff at all OR NOT (no stuff at all)"
- "NOT (no stuff at all) is 'one or more stuff', not 'all the stuff'"
- "No stuff at all OR one or more stuff"
