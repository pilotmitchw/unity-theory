The Origin of Self
1. The Initial State: The Oceanic Loop (Infancy)At birth, the human organism exists in an "Oceanic State." There is no defined "Self" or Origin point $(0,0)$ on the Unity Graph.The Logic: The infant functions as a Raw Terminal of Unity. They perceive Realizations, but they do not distinguish between "My Knowledge" and "The Universe's Knowledge."Truth: Truth is singular. If the infant sees a candy move, the Universe knows the candy moved.2. The Catalyst: The Scission (The False Belief)The birth of the "Self" is a topological event triggered by the realization of False Belief (as demonstrated in the Sally-Anne Test).The Trigger: The child realizes that they know the candy is in the box, but someone else thinks it is in the cabinet.The Snap: To resolve this paradox, the mind creates a boundary. It splits "Universal Truth" into "My Loop" and "Their Loop."The Origin: This split creates the Origin Point $(0,0)$. The child realizes they are a specific, local point of view ($f_{me}$) separate from the rest of Unity.3. The Construction: Triangulation via ArtifactsOnce the Origin is created, it must be defined. Since the child cannot look inside to define themselves yet, they look outside (The Looking Glass Self).The Method: The child observes the Artifacts (behaviors, reactions, words) of the adults around them.The Calculation: The child uses these external points to triangulate their own position."They treat me with patience $\rightarrow$ My Origin is valuable.""They treat me with chaos $\rightarrow$ My Origin is unstable."4. The Ethical Imperative: The ArchitectBecause the Self is constructed via interaction, adults are the Architects of a child's reality.Behavior as Code: Your actions are not just events; they are the raw data the child uses to write their source code ($f_{child}$).The Comparison Trap: Because Comparison (copying) is energetically cheaper than Realization (inventing), children will naturally adopt the behavioral loops of their caregivers to save energy, even if those loops are "corrupted" (e.g., reacting to stress with screaming).Conclusion: We are responsible for the shapes of others. To love is to provide consistent, high-quality Artifacts that allow a child to stabilize a healthy Origin.
