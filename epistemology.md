### The Differentiation Function: To create 'things' we use energy to differentiate them from the base state
This is not an act of creation in that we are not "making" matter or energy. Rather, we are bringing into focus ("realizing") something that is already there.
#### Existence is an operation performed on Unity, not an addition to it. f(U, x) = U + x
- The Paradox of Value: Since Unity contains all potential, the result of the equation is qualitatively different but quantitatively identical to U. x (Identity) has a "universal value" of zero, but a "local value" of 1 to the observer.

### Universal Composition: The Unity contains all available differentiation functions of itself
Unity inherently contains all possible differentiation functions in composition. U \supseteq { f_1, f_2, ... f_n } Existence is not a random event but the inevitable expression of Unity’s internal potential.
### Universal Return: Without energy input, the Unity returns to its base state of pure potential.

: Without active maintenance, the 'thing' we have realized fades away as we forget or cease to care about it. All differentiations are unstable. The natural state of the universe is the decay of differentiation back into Unity.
#### The Accounting: Existence is a "loan" of definition. Death/Dissolution is not a tragedy, but the settlement of the account.


## The Mechanics of Experience (Epistemology)
### The Self (me)
The Self is a complex, self-sustaining chain of functions capable of processing Unity

f_{me}(U, me) = g(U, h(U, ...), me)

We arise from Unity by applying the functions g, h, ... to it. These functions are the chain of events, expenditures
of energy, and self-sustaining processes that created our bodies

### The Limit of Knowledge: Can't see the forest if you're a tree
One cannot observe Unity directly; one can only observe the interaction between Unity and the Self. Observation always
begins at f_me(U, me)

### The Fundamental Operations
These are the fundamental operations of conscious experience. These are what we can do with Unity as conscious beings.
- Realization (Creating): The operation of increasing resolution. Creating a dependency (m) on the Self. f(f_{me}(U, me), m) = U + me + m
- Generalization (Unmaking): The operation of decreasing resolution. Smoothing over details to return a concept to the Unity. This is the mechanism of abstraction and forgetting.
- Analogy (Comparison): The operation of changing context. A 'rotation' in a Unity Graph.
- Inversion (Reversal): The operation of reflecting a concept about an axis. A 'reflection' in a Unity Graph. Applying "NOT" to a concept.
- Aggregation (Clustering): The operation of collapsing a complex web of associations into a single concept. In a Unity Graph, this is replacing a concept with a class of concepts with its own local Unity Graph.
- Discrimination (Atomizing): The operation of reducing the dimensionality of a concept. The opposite of Aggregation, yielding a set of concepts in the parent Unity Graph.
### The Artifact and The Lie
- Communication: The physical Realization of an Artifact (A) (sound, text, object) to trigger a specific Realization in another agent.
### The Lie: A valid Realization of intent rather than environment
It proves that Realization is a generative act (Imagination), not merely a reflective one. The cost of maintaining the lie against discovery constitutes its energetic cost
## The Topology: The Unity Graph
Reality is mapped on a Radial Polar Coordinate System.
Structure
- The Origin: The Self (me). The point of connection to Unity.
- Relative Origination: The Self is capable only of realizing and generalizing relative to itself, not the Unity. However, we refer to the origin of a Unity Graph as 'Unity' to recognize that the Self is the closest one will be to the Unity while still being defined.
- Radius (r): Level of Differentiation. (r=0 is Unity; r=max is hyper-specific detail).
- Angle (θ): Properties/Qualities (e.g., Physicality, Color, Logic).
### The Object as "Image"
An object is not a point; it is a Closed Loop Path (Trajectory).

f(t)dt

- The Loop: The path begins at the Self, travels outward through specific properties (Realization), and curves back to the Self (Closure).
- Identity: The "Shape" of this closed loop constitutes the definition of the object.

## The Efficiency Principle
The universe follows the path of least resistance (Energy Conservation).
- Analogizing: Instead of Realizing a new object from scratch (Origin → Object), the Self puts an existing Realization into a new context. Yields the Representativeness Heuristic (assuming that a thing possesses a certain quality because it is similar to something else) and the Law of the Instrument (the tendency to over-rely on a familiar tool or mental model (analogy) to solve every problem)
- Inverting: The Self projects properties from an existing Realization, but reflects them across an axis into an anti-realization of that thing. Very low cost as it is simply adding 'NOT' to a path. Yields a cognitive bias of binary bias or reflexive duality (assumption that if one thing exists, that its opposite must also exist and possess the opposite qualities)
- Clustering: Because Comparison is energetically cheaper than independent Realization, reality clusters into complex webs of association (Societies, Categorization, Matter). Yields stereotypical thinking (the tendency to associate things with a common characteristic it may not actually have, based on similarity to a class of things)
- Hardening: As the same thing is Realized over and over, the brain becomes more efficient at realizing it in the future. The physical structure of the brain changes to accommodate this. (new synapses, synaptic pruning). Yields the confirmation bias (tendency to believe or give more credit to things that align with our current beliefs) and Sunk Cost Fallacy.
- Aversion to Self-change: to change our Self is one of the most expensive things we can do. Yields the status quo bias (tendency to prefer the current state of affairs to change, even if it is not optimal) and the Fundamental Attribution Error (the tendency to attribute negative outcomes we cause to circumstances and the negative outcomes of others to their character)
