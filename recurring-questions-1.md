# How can everything be nothing at the same time? That's impossible!
"The Unity is Everything and Nothing at the same time" is just the easiest way I can think of to get most of the way to
my point without getting stuck arguing about words. Everything is 'all the things' and Nothing is 'none of the things'
and I get why it sounds like a paradox. I promise you it is not a zen koan. Honestly, I think it's one of the least
interesting or exciting parts of the theory. It's just saying "stuff exists, let's call it 'Unity' for a while"

# Is the Unity 'infinite potential' or is it a 'real, physical thing?'
This question is most directly answered with "It's the real, physical everything that exists.
Potentially anything possible can be found when you are realizing things in it." The more controversial or exciting you 
think it is, you're getting farther away from what I mean. It's just a name for a concept. You can call it the 'cosmos' 
or the 'universe' or 'Betty' or whatever. It's just the things that exist and can exist, lumped into one big blob and 
named something.

# Does the Unity exist when I'm not looking at it?
Yes. Things do not stop existing because we are not looking at or thinking about them. However, a sunset does not know
or care that it is a sunset, and it continues being beautiful anyway. It exists, but it has a name only when *we* give
it a name.
