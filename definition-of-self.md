# The self's purpose
The purpose of a self is to be a stable reference point from which to measure the differences we realize
from the Unity. It's a convention, bounded by biology and partly encoded in our DNA; and thus persistent and heritable, 
whose value is so great to our survival that we define ourselves *as* it.

# The self is an active physical process that consumes energy to maintain a separation between 'Me' and 'The Unity'
The self is as much a part of our bodies as the heart is. I've never subscribed to the notion that there's a border
between our minds and our bodies. When we sleep, our experience ceases outside of dreaming, which itself can be
detected with an ECG. 

# The self is partially determined by our genomes
Some animals exhibit self-directed behaviors. I don't know if this fits the definition of a 'self' in the human sense, 
but it suggests to me that the potential for self-awareness either arose early in evolution or is a convergent 
evolution.

# Connection to religion and Unity Theory's cost to the author
One of religion's functions is to help define ourselves in the universe. Our origin, our purpose, and our futures. A
religion is a set of institutionalized realizations that provides a scaffold for self-development and maintenance. 
Without one, a human has to derive their own realizations to build on. This is possible but is definitely not the
Realizing Unity Theory has consumed years of my attention, and I don't see any near future where it'll be ready to call 
it done. I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss the simpler way, but that religious scaffold failed under the load of
events in my life. The pain and fear were too great to allow for it to continue, and I had to do something about it. 
But when you change yourself like that, the cost isn't just energetic but psychological and social as well. I know the 
change confuses the people closest to me. It causes arguments and distance I'd rather not have to manage. It's really
frightening at times, something like I imagine being adrift at sea would be. If life is the sea and Unity Theory
is my raft, I can grieve the loss of the boat that carried me this far, but that loss doesn't mean I'm giving up. It's
been about seven years since that crisis of faith. Unity Theory might be a raft, but it's a raft I built now that I am
now able to control. The raft feels like home now because it *is* home. Looking at the vast ocean of reality is starting
to feel like a friend. A flakey, short-tempered friend that gets into too many fights, sure, but still a friend. 
Unity Theory was and is extremely costly, but I wouldn't say it's not worth it. Is that sunk cost fallacy? Maybe. I can
hardly deny it since it's part of the theory. But before, I felt like a passenger, and now I feel like a mariner. That
makes it all worth it to me.
