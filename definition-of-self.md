# The self's purpose
The purpose of a self is to be a stable reference point from which to measure the differences we realize
from the Unity. It's a convention, bounded by biology and partly encoded in our DNA; and thus persistent and heritable, 
whose value is so great to our survival that we define ourselves *as* it.

# The self is an active physical process that consumes energy to maintain a separation between 'Me' and 'The Unity'
The self is as much a part of our bodies as the heart is. I've never subscribed to the notion that there's a border
between our minds and our bodies. When we sleep, our experience ceases outside of dreaming, which itself can be
detected with an ECG. 

# The self is partially determined by our genomes
Some animals exhibit self-directed behaviors. I don't know if this fits the definition of a 'self' in the human sense, 
but it suggests to me that the potential for self-awareness either arose early in evolution or is a convergent 
evolution.

# Connection to religion
One of religion's functions is to help define ourselves in the universe. Our origin, our purpose, and our futures. A
religion is a set of institutionalized realizations that provides a scaffold for self-development and maintenance. 
Without one, a human has to derive their own realizations to build on. This is possible but is definitely not the
Realizing Unity Theory has consumed years of my attention, and I don't see any near future where it'll be ready to call 
it done. I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss the simpler way, but for reasons I cannot quite realize, my mind
refuses to accept the expediency any longer.
