# Distinguishing reflexive versus deliberate dualism
The cognitive shortcut of inversion is very cheap, which means brains love to use it. When deliberate and objective,
it's a powerful tool for understanding and creating new ideas. When the brain gets the chance to, though, it will
happily apply it to everything it can, and that leads to what I call a 'reflexive dualism.'

A reflexive dualism is that automatic assumption that if one thing exists, its opposite must also. This is so easy to
do that it will happen without you noticing, so trying to stop it is not the best way to handle it. It's better
to test your dualistic identities to see how deliberate they are. You can do it by applying what I call the 
*symmetric stability test*.

Reflexive dualities and deliberate dualities sound like they'd be hard to distinguish, and on occasion, they are. But
it's hardly impossible because there are hints that a duality might be reflexive rather than deliberate. The biggest
indicator is the *failure to preserve complexity*.

In information theory, inverting information does not destroy it. It makes it into a mirror image of the original.
A deliberate duality results in a *complex, useful image* and a reflexive duality *destroys information*.

Think about 'hot.' What does it mean for something to be hot? It means there's a lot of random thermal motion of the
molecules making it up. We perceive this by touch as that thing being 'hot.' What is 'cold' then? It's...well...it's...
um...not hot. It's effectively just the absence of being hot. 

This is characteristic of reflexive duality. The complexity of heat capacity, capacitance, thermodynamics and motion
of heat from sources to sinks is all wiped out and the opposite thing is just definable as 'not hot' or 'cold.' Because
it is probably reflexive, its usefulness and complexity are much less than 'hot.' 'hot' can make an engine run, and 'cold'
is what sits around mooching off its popularity.

A deliberate duality results in a *complex, useful anti-concept*, not a definition that means just 'not that thing.' 
The dualistic mirror of 'hot' is 'anti-hot.' It would be the opposite of heat, equally 'energetic,' but in the opposite 
direction. It would feel exactly like hot because it's *still that motion*, but run in reverse, and that's difficult to 
intuit. It requires rigor to create the anti-concept, and that rigor is what preserves the usefulness of the dualism.

A successful duality is the notion of a 'hole' in semiconductor engineering. In semiconductor materials, purified 
silicon (4 valence electrons) form a defined crystalline structure. Phosphorus (5 valence electrons) or Boron (3 valence
electrons) are added in tiny, precise amounts (the process is called 'doping'); amounts so tiny that the Silicon
bullies it into conforming to the crystalline shape. Phosphorus has to give up an electron and Boron adopts one, not
the ideal for either element, but peer-pressure is powerful even on the atomic scale, it would seem.

Anyway, the Phosphorus-doped silicon has an excess of free electrons and so is called "N type" (for "negative"). 
Boron-doped silicon has a dearth of free electrons, so it is "P type" (for 'positive'). It's not very useful to think
of P type material in this way, though. It's more useful to think of it as containing many 'holes.' or absences that
can be filled. Holes are used to predict and design semiconductor devices by acting as a kind of 'positive charge,'
although, really, it's the *absence* of an electron in a place where it would be energetically favorable to
be one. It's *really*, if you want to be pedantic, the positive charge of scantily clad phosphorus nuclei leaking out.

See what I mean about rigor? It's a far cry from 'cold,' given you can build transistors with it. It's an example
of a *deliberate* duality — complex, useful, and rigorously applied for a practical purpose rather than as only 
an expedient.
