# The counter-force to entropy is adaptability
If it was purely a matter of energy conservation, there would be little motivation to invest the energy in new
realizations and updating old beliefs. The need to remain flexible to maintain control over a changing environment 
is what makes consciousness such a powerful evolutionary benefit. 

# Without a reference point, there is no order at all
Without a Self to compare things to, how would we decide if things are ordered? Having low entropy means having fewer
options, but it doesn't give meaning to them. An infinite expanse of randomly-moving particles with only two future
options is huge, extremely low in entropy, and also completely meaningless.
