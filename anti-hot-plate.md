# The Anti-Hot Plate Thought Experiment
If *cold* is a reflexive duality made from *hot*, what would the deliberate duality look like?

## Definition of Heat
"The form of energy crossing the boundary of a thermodynamic system by virtue of a temperature difference across
the boundary"

### Reflexive
"Cold" = the absence of that crossing. The lack of movement or activity between a thermodynamic system by virtue
of a temperature difference across the boundary.

### Deliberate
"Anti-Heat" = the form of energy crossing the boundary of a thermodynamic system by virtue of a temperature difference
across the boundary in the opposite direction as heat

## The Cold Plate vs the Anti-Hot Plate
Every good philosophical discussion should include a hot drink. Let's make one. I'm having English Breakfast tea but 
you can make it whatever you want. To get there, we need boiling water. So - let's get started!

Let's take a hot plate—I just went online and searched 'hot plate' and picked a representative example. It uses
resistive heating to make a coil hot. Nice and simple if you generalize it to 'machine that makes hot', which is all
we need for now.

### The Cold Plate
Let's now say that I pulled out a new invention—the Cold Plate. This thing is amazing—it's a machine that, when powered,
completely prevents heat. You expect transfer across that border? No way, my friend. The Cold Plate stops it COLD.

Let's plug it up and try it out. Take the kettle, put it on there and - see? The water doesn't boil!
