# UNITY THEORY
Version 1.1

By Mitchell Wright

Changes from 1.0
- rewrote abstract and ontology sections to reflect Unity Theory's intent as a cognitive tool
- trying a more Socratic approach to the ontology part
- extracted the epistemology to "epistemology.md"
- extracted the abstract to "abstract.md"

## What Is? (Ontology)
Western philosophy has struggled mightily with "From Nothing comes Nothing." This statement implies a lot about
the universe: it makes a creator obligatory (or requires an Olympic level of mental gymnastics to talk around), 
asserts that the initial state was utter Void or nothingness (rather arbitrarily, in my opinion, but I'll get to that),
and creates a kind of structural duality that seems oppressive in its reach.

### The Big Bang Theory (not the show)
The Big Bang theory doesn't state that nothing 'blew up' and became something. It states that the universe, as far as we
can see, started in a state of infinite density. It's natural to imagine this as a tiny point in a vast void, but 
nothing about the theory said it had to be tiny. That's just an intuitive idea we got from explosives. The name doesn't 
do us any favors in this regard, as it's hard to imagine a 'Big Bang' that didn't BANG in the way bombs do.

So, let's discard that assumption. The Universe began in a state of infinite density, but let's say that it was also
infinitely large. It 'bangs' and there's a flurry of activity as things 'cool' out of it, some of it annihilating with
anti-stuff and disappearing, other bits going this way or that based on, basically, being 'wobbly.' Age for several 
billions of years and you get what we see every day. Lots of people look at it and go "wow, how amazing" but I - I don't
know why—I think of it all more as just being there. It's amazing, sure, but I don't feel like it's a miracle. Isn't
it more of an...anti-miracle? If we're calling everything miraculous, 'miraculous' is just a more dramatic way 
of saying 'is.' 

### What is Everything? What is Nothing?
When I look at the world, I see 'things' (objects whose identity I care about) and 'stuff' (the rest of it). But those
groups don't stay the same. As I pay attention to an object, it moves from being 'stuff' to a 'thing.' When I'm done 
with it, I shove it back into the mental box of 'stuff.' We all do this, thousands of times a day, and nobody seems
bothered by it. It seems like it's fair game to put whatever name on 'stuff' I want during this operation. The world
is so complex that we have to put *multiple* names on things, many of them shared with others. Because we're in Western
philosophy, we should turn this on the extremes of the duality 'everything' and 'nothing.'

But when you try, it doesn't really work. What name can we put on 'everything' other than just...'all the things'?
It exists in a kind of quantum mechanical uncertainty. If you touch it, it collapses to, well - nothing. Trying to 
define it in any way destroys it. Is Everything large or small? It has to be both. Otherwise, it wouldn't be Everything
anymore. Even its name is confusing. "Every" and "thing"? Which ones? The answer: yes. But is THAT one it? No. If a recipe calls for an
'Everything' in the bowl—what do I do? Did I already do it? Is Everything already in the bowl, but most of it is hanging
off the edge like stubborn pancake batter that refuses to accept the inevitable? If I put milk into that bowl,
haven't I just failed to put Everything in it?

What about 'nothing'? "No" and "thing." Which things? Answer: no. Is that one Nothing? No. Is it what's in the bowl before I   
put milk in? Does it have any size? If it doesn't, it can't be *in* anything. If it does, how big is it? I've never  
seen a Nothing, and my understanding is that modern physics' answer to "Is there a real, physical Nothing?" is "Dunno" 
but said with scary stories involving unreasonably angry subatomic particles.

No matter what I point at, no matter what I do or think, I can never point to a thing, ask, "Is that Everything?" and 
"Is that Nothing?", and get a different answer. The only *property* that Everything and Nothing seem to have is this
infuriating absence of identity, and if every other means of finding them in the world fails, on what grounds
can I really say they are different things? What if they aren't?

### Enter: The Unity
Since everyone seems fine with just giving names to things, I feel at liberty to do so as well. So, I'll name the lack
of any identity 'The Unity.' It's 'all the things' with the bonus of 'all the possible things.' In fact, it lacks
boundaries or internal division of any kind, and to make it usable, I'm also defining the answer to pointing at 
*anything* and asking "Is that the Unity?" is *always* YES. It is, by definition, both EVERYTHING and NOTHING.

### The Unity is in all possible and potential states at the same time
This is the state of total freedom of definition.     

### The Unity is always present and is always locally observable, but we can never observe its whole or base state
The Unity is always present in any situation, but we call it different things depending on the context. If we don't care
about it right now, we call it "not what I'm talking about" or "the rest of it." 

### Revisiting "From Nothing comes Nothing" with the Unity
With the Unity, "From Nothing comes Nothing" is still technically true but now is uninteresting. Looking at Nothing
from the perspective of the Unity turns it into "From Everything comes Anything." With the Unity, the dualism implicit
in "From Nothing comes Nothing" just...goes away. There's no longer an obligatory creator. If the Universe's initial
state at the time of the Big Bang was *Unity*, then the confusion evaporates. It's just things happening, derived from
an entity that already contained its own future. The state we observe now, including all of us, is no longer random but
*inevitable*. You can put the Unity in a bowl, and it is there before you put it in at the same time. The bowl is the 
Unity. YOU are the Unity. I am the Unity. Nothing is the Unity. Everything is the Unity. The Unity just *IS*.

And it's surprisingly useful.
