# Problems with Unity Theory
## Epistemology section focus
- The style is marginally more approachable than the axioms stuff, but only by a little. It would benefit from
the same Socratic treatment.
- Including death here is jarring and dips into the morality part. Stick with explaining why things dissolve back
into Unity
- The definition of Self as a chain of functions is too abstract and doesn't express the scale of our own
existence that I was hoping to get across. 
- Including a recursive definition without explaining recursion might be
confusing to some readers. 
- The same is true about using mathematical notation. Maybe moving the math to an appendix would be better. I think it's
useful, but here, it gets in the way of more important ideas.
- The 'Fundamental Operations' list is too declarative. It would be more engaging to have a narrative where we go through
and use each one where it is useful.
- I think making a whole capital 'A' Artifact gets in the way. It's "stuff you write, stuff you say." Just say it like that.
- The Lie section should be separated and made into a narrative about how lying being possible means realization creates
a connection in a mental map but not an actual thing. In 1.0, it could be attacked as 'you think you're creating things
when you lie', which is not the point.
- Move the Unity Graph into its own section. It's going to be more math-heavy by design and it isn't critical to the
"What if we start with Unity?" question.
- "Radial Polar Coordinate System" is suicidal. 99 percent of people that read THAT are going to go either "A what now?"
or have trauma flashbacks to calculus. Neither is ideal. Start with an example of a thing and try to use cartesian coordinates,
showing WHY radial polar is better (only two attributes can be compared at a time with XY plane)
- Separate the Efficiency Principle from the cognitive bias parts. Do the cognitive biases separately. First
go over the operations showing how they save energy, then go back over later and explain how they can lead to mistakes.
- More emphasis on the consequences of cognitive biases might help. Just listing 'stereotyping' as if it's an ok
thing to do all the time might be taken as offensive.
- Start with the neurology and advance TO the Unity Graph. The graph is supposed to be a tool to help understand the 
neurology visually.
- Pick a terminology. It's either an 'image' or an 'identity.' I'm leaning towards 'identity' because it's already
mentioned in the ontology section.
- Try applying it to "I think, therefore, I am." In Unity Theory, this would become something like "There is a 'me'
to think because I am thinking of a 'me' while I'm thinking"
- Expand 'Hardening' into a sequence of events while learning something. First you follow instructions, then, as you
get more used to it, it becomes more automatic as your brain establishes a loop for it. As you continue, the thing
you are learning becomes more and more optimized until it almost becomes a part of the Self, which is technically true
if the physical structure of your brain has changed during the optimization. This is where mastery lives, where the
learned thing becomes part of how you understand *other* things.
- Also expand the aversion to self-change here. It's a big point.
