## Abstract

Unity Theory is a cognitive framework that begins with the idea that reality is a single undifferentiated and boundless
state of potential called Unity (U). Identities are not inherent to matter but rather are the product of sustained, active
cognitive processes. These are subject to thermodynamics and create an energy economy of thought. Our brains have
evolved strategies to save energy while maintaining these identities. We reduce their complexity by grouping them into classes,
discarding irrelevant details, and employing heuristics to infer those details later based on previous experiences.
Changing one's mind comes with a real physical cost, and our brains optimize the most frequently used processes. This
increases the cost to change them as they must be stripped of optimization before they can be modified. Common cognitive
biases such as confirmation bias arise from our efforts to avoid paying these costs.
