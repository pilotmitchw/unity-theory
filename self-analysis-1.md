# Problems with Unity Theory 1.0
By the Author, Mitchell Wright 

It's so dense and academic. I understand it because I made it, but I doubt anyone else would be interested in 
figuring it out. I want to get to the heart of the "everything and nothing are the same thing" idea without sounding
pretentious or mysterious. It is a shift in thinking that needs a lot of explanation and support.

Axioms feel too academic and mathematical, especially at the start. I'd like to make something that people can enjoy
reading as well as thinking about. Saying they're 'axioms' makes it sound like I'm trying to make a statement about
what the universe IS. What I hope to do is make a tool to help me think about the universe, not try to force the universe
to fit into the theory. I want to soften the assertions so they're not so absolute and binding.

The problem that Unity Theory is trying to solve is the problem of "From nothing comes nothing". I want to propose that
may be so, but if the original state of the universe is *wholeness* (the Unity, as infinite potential for all things),
there is not really a 'nothing' for 'nothing' to come out of. It makes the statement "From everything comes anything."
It removes the need for a creator as a creator is not necessary for something that has always existed.

I have to explain why we feel like 'nothing' is really different from 'everything.' My initial idea is that when we
think of 'nothing,' we are reflecting on our own non-existence, both past and future. My argument here is that Unity
always held the potential for 'me' in it already, and I never really didn't exist. I just was realized for a certain 
time.

The Unity Graph idea needs more work. It sounds truthy, but I'd like to have a more solid foundation than that. Example
graphs would help a lot. If I could make a 3d simulation of one, I could show what I imagine the operations would
look like (for analogy, rotation of the whole scene, etc).

The Unity Graph also has connections to neural networks and brains. A 'realization loop' can be a literal loop of
neurons firing each other. The increased energy cost can be directly explained too, as 'adding more things means more 
neurons are firing.'

I want to defer morality for now. I want a better idea of what is before trying to figure out what should be.

Overall, it's a good start but it reads like a philosophy textbook and *I* don't like reading those, so why would
many others?
