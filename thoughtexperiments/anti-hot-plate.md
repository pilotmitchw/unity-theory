# The Anti-Hot Plate Thought Experiment
If *cold* is a reflexive duality made from *hot*, what would the deliberate duality look like?

## Definition of Heat
"The form of energy crossing the boundary of a thermodynamic system by virtue of a temperature difference across
the boundary"

### Reflexive
"Cold" = the absence of that crossing. The lack of movement or activity between a thermodynamic system by virtue
of a temperature difference across the boundary.

### Deliberate
"Anti-Heat" = the form of energy crossing the boundary of a thermodynamic system by virtue of a temperature difference
across the boundary in the opposite direction as heat

## The Cold Plate vs the Anti-Hot Plate
Every good philosophical discussion should include a hot drink. Let's make one. I'm having English Breakfast tea, but 
you can make it whatever you want. To get there, we need boiling water. So - let's get started!

Let's take a hot plate—I just went online and searched 'hot plate' and picked a representative example. It uses
resistive heating to make a coil hot. Nice and simple if you generalize it to 'machine that makes hot,', which is all
we need for now.

### The Cold Plate
Our hot plate is also a cold plate. All we have to do is not plug it in and, lo, it is not hot! 



### The Anti-Hot Plate
An anti-hot plate would consume power to anti-heat our pot of water. Energy is conserved, so this power has to go
somewhere, which leads to this point: the anti-hot plate cannot make things cold because that would not conserve
energy.
