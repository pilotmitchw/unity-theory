Applied Paradox: The Ship of Theseus
The Problem: If parts of a ship are replaced, does the ship remain the same? The Unity Theory Solution:
1. Identity is a Pattern: The "Ship" is a Realization Loop projected by the observer, not the wood itself.
2. The Swap: When a plank is removed, the observer applies Generalization to the old wood, returning it to the status of generic "Material" (dropping it from the Ship Loop).
3. The Project: The observer projects the "Shipness" property onto the new plank via Comparison.
4. Resolution: The Ship persists because the Shape of the Loop is maintained by the observer's energy, regardless of the medium flowing through it. The "Shed Ship" (old wood) creates a paradox only if the observer fails to Generalize the old parts.
