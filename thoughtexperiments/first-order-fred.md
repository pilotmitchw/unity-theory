Suppose there's a guy named Fred that has a very strange quirk; he only thinks in first-order logic. To Fred,
everything is a 'thing.' Fred doesn't ever think of 'stuff.' It wouldn't make sense to him at all. Anytime you 
say 'stuff' to Fred, his brain translates it into language he understands like 'a bunch of things.'

Let's follow Fred and see what his life is like.

Let's suppose Fred's wife is Norma. One day, Norma asks Fred to pick up "some stuff from the store" and gives him a list.
Aha! he thinks, Norma wants me to pick up these THINGS; apples, sugar, and milk.

Fred heads to the store and looks at his list. "Apples". That's easy enough. At least two apples. So Fred puts 
two apples in his cart. He performs a logical test on his cart "The cart contains apples = true". Life is good.

Next: sugar. Fred wheels over to the baking section and freezes before towering shelves of bags and boxes of sugar. To 
Fred, 'sugar' is A thing, a singular thing. There is either sugar or there is not. There is _definitely_ sugar on 
the store shelves. An incomprehensively large _number_ of sugar. Millions of sugar. Possibly billions of sugar!

Hesitantly, Fred's quivering hand closes on a box of white sugar and he puts it in his cart. He performs his reality test:
"The cart contains sugar = ...maybe?" There is NOT a sugar in the cart—there are MANY SUGARS in the cart!

Norma should have asked for 'a box of sugars,' but it's too late for that now. Fred is spiraling now—sugar, sugar, sugar...
millions of sugar, is there a God? What even is reality?! Wait...it must be...Norma wants ONE SUGAR ONLY!

With a sigh of relief and the pounding of his own heart subsiding from his ears, Fred very carefully takes one granule 
of sugar and puts it into a bag (from the produce section, obviously). He ties it shut, drops it in the cart, and 
"The cart contains sugar = true." Crisis averted. Little does he know, his greatest nightmare is fast approaching as 
he ambles to the dairy coolers, dumb, fat, and happy in exactly three quantifiable instances of 'things someone can be.'

At the coolers now, Fred is feeling pretty good. Liquid isn't a problem; he knows that a liquid can be big or small,
that doesn't mean anything. A milk is a milk, right? He grabs a pint (chosen by the fact that its container curved
in an alluring manner) and is about to drop it into the cart before the label catches his eye. As he looks at the label, 
he reads IT. The horrifying number. 2%. 2%? Fred thinks, 2% of what?! Isn't this a milk?! 

Outraged, Fred stomps to the customer service desk and throws down the offending bottle, severely wounding an
unfortunate ballpoint pen launched into the lotto ticket display by the impact. He demands the remaining 98% of the milk
and launches into a tirade about Big Cow adulterating the honest working man's milk with some mysterious...NOT MILK?! 
Normally this would be a Scene but...everyone around here knows Fred. The attendant sighs and, not wanting to
get into the nuances of milkfat content, replaces the 2% milk with a pint of whole milk instead.

Mollified for now, Fred checks out and pays the six one-dollar bills, two quarters, one nickel, and two pennies for his 
two apples and singular pint of WHOLE milk. He stuffs the sugar into his pocket, on the grounds that the store tried to
poison him with not-milk, and they owed him exactly one sugar for it. With a harumph, Fred heads home, absolutely
confident that he pleased his wife with his completely accurate purchase of the four things on the list:
Apple A, Apple B, Sugar C, and WHOLE milk D.

The point of this? Fred would be very happy with "From Nothing comes Nothing." That should be a warning to us, not 
something to base our understanding of reality on.
