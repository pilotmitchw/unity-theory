# The Atlas game
The Atlas game is a physical thought-experiment that I used to try and understand more about the assumptions
that my mind makes about the world. Anyone can do it at any time, but I can't guarantee that your experience will be
the same as mine. I suspect it will be similar, but all I can do is describe my experience and leave it to you to compare
my description to your own experience.
## The setup
Make yourself mobile. Walk, run, jump around a little. Pay attention to how it feels to move about the surrounding space.
I found this start to be a little silly and might be embarrassed if anyone was watching. After a while, I got bored because
 little was different.
## Become Atlas
Atlas holds the world on his shoulders, right? The whole world. Atlas is a mythical figure from Greek mythology who is 
known for his strength and endurance. In the Atlas game, you are asked to imagine that you are Atlas, holding the world 
on your shoulders. That would get boring after a while, so what if you put the world down and stood on it instead? 
Let's ignore the physics of giant divine feet flattening the East Coast. Imagine that you are Atlas, standing on the world,
and you start walking. Imagine and *believe* that you are walking on the world as though it were a literal ball.
Imagine that instead of moving yourself through space, you are using your *feet* to rotate the Earth under you. According to
Newton's third law, you *are* rotating the Earth under you anyway. I used that to suspend belief and it worked for me. Take a few
steps and think about you pushing the Earth with your feet and it spinning under you. 
## Balance?
When it worked, I felt a sense of visceral unease that is like the one I imagine I'd feel if I was walking on a ball.
This was weird enough by itself, but as I started walking around and watched the things around me moving, I didn't *feel*
like *I* was moving anymore. Walking across a room felt like the room was actually moving around *me*. Walking through
a door was me spinning the Earth so the door went *over* me. Intellectually I knew nothing was different, but my 
perception of just walking was different and more than a little unsettling. I felt a fear of falling or tripping that
I didn't have minutes before doing the same thing. I wouldn't say it was life-changing, but it surprised me with how
novel walking felt. I imagined that this might be what it felt like to walk for the first time, or closer to it, at least.
## Thoughts afterwards
After walking around a little more, I let the 'belief' that I was actually rotating the Earth with my feet go and walking
felt normal again. Then I set up the belief again and the feeling was the same. It surprised me how easily I could 
change how I could change my perception of movement by just believing something I made up. I wondered what this meant
about what else I could change by altering my belief temporarily. More importantly, I wondered *why* it was possible and
what it implied about what my thoughts and feelings actually were, if they could so easily be made disconcerting by
a whimsical belief of walking on the Earth like Atlas being bored out his mind. 
## Conclusions
I'm still thinking about the experience and doing it occasionally. From this experience, I started to consider what the
*difference* between the two states of mind were and why one (the everyday) felt normal and the other (the game) *felt*
so different. Thinking differently, sure, I expected that, but feeling like I could fall over? It suggests that my sense 
of balance depends, in part, on my *belief* about what I'm doing. It implies that a state of feeling unbalanced where
no unbalance exists can be so *real* to the point where my body decides that it has to take action to stop from falling over.
If that's the case, what else that feels so *real* and normal as walking across a room has a similar inversion of belief? And
if my arbitrary belief can have that much of an effect on me, what does that imply about the beliefs I feel are natural?
Are those equally arbitrary? Do I believe that I'm moving myself through the world rather than moving the world around me 
because it's *true* or just because it's more familiar? What else do I believe because it's familiar?
