# Unity Theory
Version 1.1

By Mitchell Wright

Changes from 1.0
- extracted the Unity Graph stuff to unity-graph-1.0.md

## Epistemology
### Who am I? What am I?



### The Limit of Knowledge: Can't see the forest if you're a tree
One cannot observe Unity directly; one can only observe the interaction between Unity and the Self. Observation always
begins at f_me(U, me)

### How do I do it?
#### Basic tools
- Realization (Creating): The operation of increasing resolution. Creating a dependency (m) on the Self. f(f_{me}(U, me), m) = U + me + m
- Generalization (Unmaking): The operation of decreasing resolution. Smoothing over details to return a concept to the Unity. This is the mechanism of abstraction and forgetting.
#### Refined tools
- Analogy (Comparison): The operation of changing context. A 'rotation' in a Unity Graph.
- Inversion (Reversal): The operation of reflecting a concept about an axis. A 'reflection' in a Unity Graph. Applying "NOT" to a concept.
- Aggregation (Clustering): The operation of collapsing a complex web of associations into a single concept. In a Unity Graph, this is replacing a concept with a class of concepts with its own local Unity Graph.
- Discrimination (Atomizing): The operation of reducing the dimensionality of a concept. The opposite of Aggregation, yielding a set of concepts in the parent Unity Graph.


### How do I know it's not just me making stuff up?
#### The Lie: A valid Realization of intent rather than environment
It proves that Realization is a generative act (Imagination), not merely a reflective one. The cost of maintaining the lie against discovery constitutes its energetic cost

### How do we communicate?
- Communication: The physical Realization of an Artifact (A) (sound, text, object) to trigger a specific Realization in another agent.
### Why do we think the way we do?
#### The Efficiency Principle
##### The Good
- Realization: allows meaning to be made from the Unity.
- Generalization: conserves energy by returning irrelevant detail to the Unity
- Analogy: changing context is easier than realizing a new identity
- Inversion: cheap because it is sticking NOT to an existing identity
- Aggregation: reduces complexity by creating a local group. Realizations from this point can start at and return to the
aggregation rather than the Unity
- Discrimination: lets us refine aggregations by surveying them and analyzing the parts of things independently of the
whole.
##### The Bad
- Realization: always the risk of realizing something wrong.
- Generalization: forgetting something that turned out to be important.
- Analogy: Applying a Universal Hammer to a Universal Nail
- Inversion: the opposite thing is also realized
- Aggregation: stereotypical thinking, assuming that a thing has a property because we cluster it into the same group as something else.
- Discrimination: overanalysis and overthinking, trying to make things that are not alike the same for energetic convenience
##### The Painfully Ugly
- Realization: delusion
- Generalization: neglect
- Analogy: anchoring
- Inversion: reflexive duality
- Aggregation: tribalism
- Discrimination: obsession

The universe follows the path of least resistance (Energy Conservation).
- Analogizing: Instead of Realizing a new object from scratch (Origin → Object), the Self puts an existing Realization into a new context. Yields the Representativeness Heuristic (assuming that a thing possesses a certain quality because it is similar to something else) and the Law of the Instrument (the tendency to over-rely on a familiar tool or mental model (analogy) to solve every problem)
- Inverting: The Self projects properties from an existing Realization, but reflects them across an axis into an anti-realization of that thing. Very low cost as it is simply adding 'NOT' to a path. Yields a cognitive bias of binary bias or reflexive duality (assumption that if one thing exists, that its opposite must also exist and possess the opposite qualities)
- Clustering: Because Comparison is energetically cheaper than independent Realization, reality clusters into complex webs of association (Societies, Categorization, Matter). Yields stereotypical thinking (the tendency to associate things with a common characteristic it may not actually have, based on similarity to a class of things)
- Hardening: As the same thing is Realized over and over, the brain becomes more efficient at realizing it in the future. The physical structure of the brain changes to accommodate this. (new synapses, synaptic pruning). Yields the confirmation bias (tendency to believe or give more credit to things that align with our current beliefs) and Sunk Cost Fallacy.
- Aversion to Self-change: to change our Self is one of the most expensive things we can do. Yields the status quo bias (tendency to prefer the current state of affairs to change, even if it is not optimal) and the Fundamental Attribution Error (the tendency to attribute negative outcomes we cause to circumstances and the negative outcomes of others to their character)
