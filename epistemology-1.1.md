Changes from 1.0

## Epistemology
### Identities
If epistemology is about how we know what we know, we'll need a box to put that in. I use 'identity' for that box.
An identity is a realized distinction between the Unity and a particular thing. 
Realizing an identity does not affect the state of Unity. It's just you focusing on something that's already there
and putting it into your box of things to care about right now.

### What am I? What's my identity?
You're probably a human. I *hope* you're a human. Otherwise, things will have gone entirely too far for Unity Theory 
to explain, and reading further would probably be useless.

I have a formal definition of the Self as "a recursive set of functions residing in the Unity that can perform
realization and generalization on the Unity." I'll put at the end of this section if you have some urgent need to 
be bored, perhaps to help fall asleep or better ignore someone nearby. I won't tell.

We are protective of our self-identities, and that's for good reason. It's the thing that you decide you are, and
you pull in concepts and relationships with others into it across a lifetime. What's in there and the container
holding it is *you*, and I am reluctant to stick a definition on it. You're...you. And I'm me. We're people, and
we think stuff and do stuff. Some of it's good and some of it's bad. Defining beyond that in a theory about energy
conservation would rather ruin the point of it all. So I'm going to say you're a person and however you define that
is what it is, but it includes the ability to realize and generalize. Or else you are reading this by some means
I don't understand but would be interested to know more about.

### The Limit of Knowledge
You can observe the surrounding Unity, but you can't see it all at once. Even if you could, you'd still be limited in
how much you can realize at once. Our brains can only handle so many things at a time, and the number is smaller than 
we'd like it to be. At the risk of outing my profession, I say the limit of knowledge arises as a matter
of bandwidth and cache size. You've only got so much brain, and if yours is like mine, your control over it is, shall 
we say, 'significantly less than absolute.'

### How do I do it?
#### Basic tools
- Realization (Creating): The operation of increasing resolution. Creating a dependency (m) on the Self. f(f_{me}(U, me), m) = U + me + m
- Generalization (Unmaking): The operation of decreasing resolution. Smoothing over details to return a concept to the Unity. This is the mechanism of abstraction and forgetting.
#### Refined tools
- Analogy (Comparison): The operation of changing context. A 'rotation' in a Unity Graph.
- Inversion (Reversal): The operation of reflecting a concept about an axis. A 'reflection' in a Unity Graph. Applying "NOT" to a concept.
- Aggregation (Clustering): The operation of collapsing a complex web of associations into a single concept. In a Unity Graph, this is replacing a concept with a class of concepts with its own local Unity Graph.
- Discrimination (Atomizing): The operation of reducing the dimensionality of a concept. The opposite of Aggregation, yielding a set of concepts in the parent Unity Graph.


### How do I know it's not just me making stuff up?
#### The Lie: A valid Realization of intent rather than environment
It proves that Realization is a generative act (Imagination), not merely a reflective one. The cost of maintaining the lie against discovery constitutes its energetic cost

### How do we communicate?
- Communication: The physical Realization of an Artifact (A) (sound, text, object) to trigger a specific Realization in another agent.
### Why do we think the way we do?
#### The Efficiency Principle
##### The Good
- Realization: allows meaning to be made from the Unity.
- Generalization: conserves energy by returning irrelevant detail to the Unity
- Analogy: changing context is easier than realizing a new identity and is the foundation of adaptation
- Inversion: cheap because it is sticking NOT to an existing identity
- Aggregation: reduces complexity by creating a local group. Realizations from this point can start at and return to the
aggregation rather than the Unity
- Discrimination: lets us check aggregations by surveying them and analyzing the parts of things independently of the
whole.
##### The Bad
- Realization: always the risk of realizing something wrong.
- Generalization: forgetting something that turned out to be important.
- Analogy: Applying a Universal Hammer to a Universal Nail.
- Inversion: the opposite thing is also realized for free, and the temptation to use it is strong.
- Aggregation: stereotypical thinking, assuming that a thing has a property because we cluster it into the same group as something else.
- Discrimination: overanalysis and overthinking, trying to make things that are not alike the same for energetic convenience.
##### The Painfully Ugly
- Realization: delusion is runaway realization, untethered to reality.
- Generalization: neglect is forgetting, willfully or not, someone else's needs.
- Analogy: freewheeling analogizing masquerading as understanding results in the Dunning-Kruger effect.
- Inversion: reflexive duality results in anti-realizations, which may be illusory but still inspire action.
- Aggregation: tribalism arises from incorporating oneself into an in-group.
- Discrimination: obsession is painful, often compulsive, and comes from trying to discriminate along a difference 
that might not exist.

The universe follows the path of least resistance (Energy Conservation).
- Analogizing: Instead of Realizing a new object from scratch (Origin → Object), the Self puts an existing Realization into a new context. Yields the Representativeness Heuristic (assuming that a thing possesses a certain quality because it is similar to something else) and the Law of the Instrument (the tendency to over-rely on a familiar tool or mental model (analogy) to solve every problem)
- Inverting: The Self projects properties from an existing Realization, but reflects them across an axis into an anti-realization of that thing. Very low cost as it is simply adding 'NOT' to a path. Yields a cognitive bias of binary bias or reflexive duality (assumption that if one thing exists, that its opposite must also exist and possess the opposite qualities)
- Clustering: Because Comparison is energetically cheaper than independent Realization, reality clusters into complex webs of association (Societies, Categorization, Matter). Yields stereotypical thinking (the tendency to associate things with a common characteristic it may not actually have, based on similarity to a class of things)
- Hardening: As the same thing is Realized over and over, the brain becomes more efficient at realizing it in the future. The physical structure of the brain changes to accommodate this. (new synapses, synaptic pruning). Yields the confirmation bias (tendency to believe or give more credit to things that align with our current beliefs) and Sunk Cost Fallacy.
- Aversion to Self-change: to change our Self is one of the most expensive things we can do. Yields the status quo bias (tendency to prefer the current state of affairs to change, even if it is not optimal) and the Fundamental Attribution Error (the tendency to attribute negative outcomes we cause to circumstances and the negative outcomes of others to their character)
