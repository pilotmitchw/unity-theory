# What is the self?
## The self is not a thing. It is an active process
### High-entropy for high function
## The self is not static
### Altered states of consciousness
#### Sleep
When we sleep, our experience of consciousness stops. 
#### Drugs
#### Pain
#### Psychosis
Psychosis is a mental health conditions characterized by a disconnection from reality, where individuals may experience
hallucinations, delusions, or impaired insight. 

The reality of psychosis is that any one of us will, with enough stress and exhaustion, become psychotic. It's what
brains do when the boundary between self and the rest of the universe wavers or breaks entirely. When we see things
that aren't there, feel things that aren't happening, and are unable to tell the difference, our minds become unable
to keep ourselves separate from Unity.

We've given a name to painful, pathological psychosis, but to what degree are positive things we experience
that defy our reality-testing also 'psychotic'? Does suspending disbelief while watching a movie or reading a book 
use similar neural pathways that, when firing out of control, create psychosis?

# The self-creation
"Who created me?" Well. You did.
